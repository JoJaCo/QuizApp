# QuizApp
Quiz app that tests the users knowledge of the flags from diffrent counrtries
no thrid party API's were used (will update if API'S are used 10/29/2020)

In this app I used google's material 1.0.0 in the gradle for the card view<androidx.cardview.widget.CardView>
I used two activity's one to take the users name and the second activity to prompt the user with the questions
the second activity uses a scrollView layout followed by a LinearLayout each section in the activity is @+id/ with there respected position
for easier changes 

layout for the questions are in a seprate data file all the Dev needs to do is add questions in the function found in Constants.kt called
fun getQuestions()
